# Psychic-Game


This game has the user guess a letter, which is compared to a letter randomly generated by the computer. The user gets 9 guesses. If the user's guess and the computer's guess match, the user wins and the number of wins increases by 1, and the number of guesses resets to 9. If the user uses all 9 guesses without matching with the computer, the number of losses increases by 1 and the number of guesses resets. This project is used to execute JavaScript functions in an interactive manner.
